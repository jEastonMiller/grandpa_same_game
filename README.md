I grew up in the 90s and my grandpa was constantly playing this game on his computer. The memory popped into my head and so decided to remake it! 

I used an emulator as reference and I am building this out so that it has ALMOST all the same functionality as the original game. (Including the outdated UI and features and goodies nested in the toolbar submenues because I don't see any reason to snap nostalgia in half.) There are a few features here and there that didn't make since to port over.

Currently: 
- Game logic is all there as well as scoring based on the original game as described by the about section in the original program (although I don't think its correct and am changing the scoring equation)
- Building out toolbar functionality and styling
- Refactoring from tailwindCSS as its scalable based on browser size and found that tailwindCSS is not great for dynamic inputs because of how it compiles

To-Do:
- Decrease loading time
- Finish retro desktop styling for atmosphere
- Make assets for different "characters" 
- Implement local storage using cookies to keep track of high scores 
- I also need to go grocery shopping and do laundry to day or tomorrow
- Deploy it

Built using:
- React
- Webpack
- Express
- Love
- Nostalgia
- Docker

Enjoy!
